\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
class {\bf APCPickup\-Policy}
\item 
class {\bf Call\-Handler}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em A class which stores information about a cross thread call. This class will keep a functor with bound parameters prior to a synchronized call, and provide a return value and exception information upon completion. \item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf Call\-Scheduler}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em A singleton class which enables a user to schedule calls across threads The Pickup\-Policy template parameter will decide how notifications are transported between the threads. \begin{Desc}
\item[Remarks:]Todo:\begin{itemize}
\item Possible tune-up: Keep one lock per queue, in addition to one for all queues. The call structure may become slow in case of many simultaneous and quick routines being called cross threads, in which case the queue mutex will lock and unlock quite rapidly.\end{itemize}
\end{Desc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deal with TLS return values and parameters, if possible. \end{itemize}
\item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf Call\-Scheduling\-Failed\-Exception}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em thrown when some undefined factor stops the scheduled call from running. \begin{Desc}
\item[Remarks:]Todo: Improve on the base exception class, to provide better message passing options \end{Desc}
\item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf Call\-Timeout\-Exception}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em thrown when a scheduled call times out. \item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf Unexpected\-Exception}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em thrown when a scheduled call throws an exception which wasn't expected by the user. \item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf Functor\-Retval\-Binder}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em A helper functor and return value class. A helper class which stores the call functor, and attempts to grab the return value after a successful call. \doxyref{Call\-Handler}{p.}{class_thread_synch_1_1_call_handler} cannot be templated without major pain in the rest of the code, so this templated type does the work. \item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf Pickup\-Policy\-Provider}
\item 
class {\bf Pickup\-Scheduling\-Failed\-Exception}
\begin{CompactList}\small\item\em thrown when a pickup policy fails. \item\end{CompactList}\item 
class {\bf WMPickup\-Policy}
\end{CompactItemize}
