December 13th, 2006 (0.7.1): 
    * Fixed missing destructor for FunctorRetvalBinder.

December 10th, 2006 (0.7.0): 
    * Initial public release.

March 13th, 2007 (0.7.2): 
    * Fixed some minor problems in the CallScheduler::syncCall templates.
    * Renamed the demo projects
    * Added a unit test project, with some initial test cases
	
July 15th, 2007 (0.7.3):
    * Fixed scoped_lock bug in CallScheduler, which could have caused undefined behavior upon a call timeout.
    * Fixed CallHandler destructor, which failed to cleanup exception expecter instance (the effect was a minor memory leak).
    * Fixed scoped_try_lock loop to correctly iterate already locked CallHandlers in CallScheduler::getNextCallFromQueue.
    * Fixed bug in CallScheduler which would reset a passed shared_ptr, leaving the original shared_ptr unchanged.
    
July 18th, 2007 (0.8.0):
    * Added sort order to expected exceptions, causing most-derived exception classes to be caught prior to any base classes.
    * Added asynchronous cross thread calls: CallScheduler::asyncCall.
    * Updated CallHandler to use boost::enable_if / disable_if to handle void overloads.
    * Updated unit tests to cover pre-call aborts and exception polymorphism.
    * Updated unit test project to use Boost's "Unit Test Execution Monitor".
    * Fixed bug which under certain circumstances could cause an empty thread queue not to be removed upon call timeouts.
